## Overview
Throughout the module, the goal was to determine the capability of opening a surf n'shake shop in Hawaii. Despite putting together a business plan, investors are concerned about the weather, and how it will impact the shop. W .Avy, one of the investors, loves the idea of opening a surf shop! However, before proceeding with the business venture, he would like the data analysis for the months of both June and December to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

### Differences between June and July 

1) The average temperature in June hits about 75 degrees and in December is lowers to 71 degrees. The average temperature between the six months is not drastic. 
2) The lowest tempertuare during June is 64 degrees and in December it lowers to 56 degrees. There is 8 degree difference between the summer and winter seasons. 
3) The hottest temperature during June is 85 degrees and in December it lowers to 83 degrees. The maximum tempertaures are extremely similar despite there being a six month difference. 

## Summary 

Overall, there is not a drastic change in temperature between the winter and summer season. However, it is vital to note that this analysis is only looking at temperature. Due to the fact that winter brings in major swells due to oncoming storms, it would be beneficial to view the precipitation differences between June and December. Additionally, running a query that compares the precipation and weather based on different locations (stations). This can provide information to where we would like to build our shop according the best weather results. Or if we already have a set location we can perfome a more detailed analysis using the stations closets to the shops location.
